                AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network
                connection
                from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS
                and
                your
                datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs,
                increase
                bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.
            </p>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                AWS Direct Connect lets you establish a dedicated network connection between your network and one of the
                AWS
                Direct Connect locations. Using industry standard 802.1q VLANs, this dedicated connection can be
                partitioned
                into multiple virtual interfaces. This allows you to use the same connection to access public resources
                such
                as
                objects stored in Amazon S3 using public IP address space, and private resources such as Amazon EC2
                instances
                running within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using private IP space, while maintaining network
                separation between the public and private environments. Virtual interfaces can be reconfigured at any
                time
                to
                meet your changing needs.

                            If you have bandwidth-heavy workloads that you wish to run in AWS, AWS Direct Connect
                            reduces
                            your
                            network costs into and out of AWS in two ways. First, by transferring data to and from AWS
                            directly,
                            you can reduce your bandwidth commitment to your Internet service provider. Second, all data
                            transferred over your dedicated connection is charged at the reduced AWS Direct Connect data
                            transfer rate rather than Internet data transfer rates.
